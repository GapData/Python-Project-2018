## Background Information on the Iris Dataset
**The Iris Dataset** is a multivariate data set. 
There are three species included in the Iris set; Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica. 
Each species has a total of 50 samples measured, leading to 150 samples in total. 
In each sample, four measurements were taken; sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. There are no missing data points and all the data is measured in centimetres. 

## How to Run my Code
* **Calculations.py -**
The first program I wrote is designed to perform statistical analysis on each of the four measurements in the Iris Dataset. It will list the minimum value, maximum value, range, interquartile range, mean, median, mode, standard deviation and variance for these measurements. 

* **Scatter1.py -**
This program looks at the relationship between the four measurements, graphing two variables against one another on a scatter diagram and calculating the correlation co-efficient for each graph. The four graphs in the order in which they appear are:

  * Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width
  * Sepal Width vs. Petal Width    
  * Sepal Length vs. Petal Length
  * Petal Length vs. Petal Width

* **Scatter2.py -**
This program looks at the relationship between the three different species, graphing two variable for each species against one another. Subplots were used to better compare these three different species side by side. 

  * Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width
  * Sepal Length vs. Petal Length
  * Sepal Length vs. Petal Width
  * Petal Length vs. Petal Width
